# Mortgages -  prediction and inference

The mortgages model is under development.

### Project overview:

The main goals of the project:
* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to analyse and visualize data, identify relationships between mortgage amount 
and key characteristics, like district, mortgage type, age group of the client, etc.     
* Prediction  - to predict the mortgages amounts based on features.
* Inference - to determine how much does a customer's age group impact the mortgage amount.
