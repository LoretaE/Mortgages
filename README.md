### Distribution of mortgages by age

In all districts, the majority of contractual mortgages for clients aged 18-55 years ranged from €50,000 (€100,000) 
to €500,000, 25% of such mortgages amounting to €1 million. The mortgages of clients aged over 55 were smaller -
the majority between €50,000 to €100,000, and only a small number of clients had larger mortgages.
Compulsory mortgage amounts are much lower - the majority up to €50,000.  A quarter of clients aged 
between 25 and 85 and only a few younger clients have a compulsory mortgage up to €100,000.
